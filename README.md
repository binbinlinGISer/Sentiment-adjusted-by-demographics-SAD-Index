- **Background:** Social media offers a unique lens to observe usersâ€™ emotions and subjective feelings toward critical events or topics and has been widely used to investigate public sentiment during crises. However, social media use varies across demographic groups, with younger people being more inclined to use social media than the older population. This digital divide could lead to biases in data representativeness, causing a persistent challenge in research based on social media data.
