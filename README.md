The dataset, Sentiment Adjusted by Demographics (SAD) index, provides an adjusted measurement of public sentiment towards COVID-19 using Twitter data through **post-stratification method**.

- **post-stratification method:** Feel free to download and try the code eample of post-stratification method, which is named as "CodeExample_post-stratification method.py". The data eexample for the code is named as "Data_example.xlsx".

- **The SAD dataset:** The SAD index data is available to the public and includes daily, weekly, and monthly SAD indexes at the state level in the U.S. for the years 2020 and 2021, named as "SAD_state_daily.xlsx", "SAD_state_weekly.xlsx", and "SAD_moonthly_weekly.xlsx", respectively.
